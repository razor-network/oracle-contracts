# System Architecture

## Overview

The Oracle Contracts system is a decentralized oracle network that enables reliable off-chain data reporting and aggregation on blockchain networks. The system uses a sophisticated architecture of smart contracts to manage data collection, stake-based validation, and reward distribution.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Applications] --> B[Oracle Network]
    B --> C[Core Contracts]
    C --> D[Data Sources]
    
    subgraph Core Contracts
        E[Block Manager]
        F[Collection Manager]
        G[Stake Manager]
        H[Vote Manager]
        I[Bond Manager]
        J[Reward Manager]
    end
    
    subgraph Data Flow
        K[Jobs]
        L[Collections]
        M[Results]
    end
```

## Core Components

### 1. Collection Management System
The Collection Manager is the primary interface for data management:
- **Jobs**: Individual data sources with specific URLs and parsing instructions
- **Collections**: Groups of related jobs with defined aggregation methods
- **Results**: Aggregated and validated data points

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Jobs] -->|Grouped into| B[Collections]
    B -->|Reported by| C[Stakers]
    C -->|Validated through| D[Consensus]
    D -->|Produces| E[Final Results]
```

### 2. Stake Management System
Manages staker participation and security:
- Stake allocation and tracking
- Slashing conditions
- Delegation mechanisms

### 3. Block Management System
Handles the epoch-based progression of the oracle:
- Block confirmation process
- Epoch transitions
- Result finalization

```mermaid

    [*] --> Commit
    Commit --> Reveal
    Reveal --> Propose
    Propose --> Confirm
    Confirm --> [*]
```

### 4. Vote Management System
Coordinates the consensus process:
- Vote collection and tracking
- Dispute resolution
- Result finalization

### 5. Bond Management System
Handles data bond management:
- Collection assignments
- Bond calculations
- Occurrence tracking

### 6. Reward Management System
Manages incentive distribution:
- Block rewards
- Staking rewards
- Penalty management

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Oracle
    participant Staker
    participant DataSource
    
    Client->>Oracle: Request Data
    Oracle->>Staker: Assign Collection
    Staker->>DataSource: Query Jobs
    DataSource->>Staker: Return Data
    Staker->>Oracle: Submit Results
    Oracle->>Oracle: Consensus Process
    Oracle->>Client: Return Validated Data
```

## Security Model

The system employs multiple security mechanisms:

1. **Staking**: Participants must stake tokens to participate
2. **Consensus**: Multi-stage validation process
3. **Slashing**: Penalties for malicious behavior
4. **Bonding**: Collection-specific security deposits

## Network States

The oracle network operates in distinct states:

```mermaid

    [*] --> Active
    Active --> Paused: Emergency
    Paused --> Active: Resolution
    Active --> Upgraded: Protocol Update
    Upgraded --> Active: Migration Complete
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IBlockManager {
        +confirmPreviousEpochBlock()
        +getBlock()
        +isBlockConfirmed()
    }
    class ICollectionManager {
        +createCollection()
        +updateCollection()
        +setResult()
        +getResult()
    }
    class IStakeManager {
        +stake()
        +unstake()
        +delegate()
    }
    class IBondManager {
        +occurrenceRecalculation()
        +getDatabondCollections()
    }
    class IVoteManager {
        +vote()
        +reveal()
        +dispute()
    }
    class IRewardManager {
        +distributeRewards()
        +calculateRewards()
    }
```

## Deployment Architecture

The system supports deployment across multiple networks:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Deployment Manager] -->|Deploy| B[Network 1]
    A -->|Deploy| C[Network 2]
    A -->|Deploy| D[Network N]
    
    subgraph Network 1
        B1[Core Contracts]
        B2[Governance]
        B3[Token Contracts]
    end
```

## Integration Points

### External Interfaces
1. **Client Integration**
   - Direct contract calls
   - Event monitoring
   - Result verification

2. **Data Source Integration**
   - URL-based data fetching
   - Multiple selector types (JSON/XHTML)
   - Custom aggregation methods

### Internal Communication
1. **Inter-Contract Communication**
   - Strict access control
   - State synchronization
   - Event-based updates

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed with several scalability features:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Multiple collections can be processed in parallel
   - Independent staker operations
   - Distributed data sourcing

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Configurable epoch lengths
   - Adjustable collection parameters
   - Flexible aggregation methods

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Planned Improvements**
   - Layer 2 integration
   - Cross-chain communication
   - Enhanced data verification methods

2. **Expansion Areas**
   - Additional data source types
   - New consensus mechanisms
   - Advanced reward systems
